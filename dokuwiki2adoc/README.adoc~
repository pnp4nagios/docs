_A study in “insanity”._

This project is a converter from DokuWiki to http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] markup.
It’s the most complete converter between these markups you can find.footnote:[If you know about better, more complete converter from DokuWiki to AsciiDoc, please let me know!]

What’s especially interesting about this converter is the implementation.
It’s completely written in https://linux.die.net/man/1/sed[*sed*]!
Moreover, using just BRE (Basic Regular Expression) with few GNU extensions and some glue in (POSIX) shell.
That’s quite insane, isn’t it?
I’d say that it’s like trying to dig a hole with just teaspoon, but it works surprisingly good!
Hence the subtitle: “A study in insanity”.footnote:[This phrase is inspired by https://prosody.im/[Prosody] – A study in simplicity.]

== Requirements

* Linux system with common userland (Busybox, GNU coreutils, ...)
* http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html[POSIX-sh] compatible shell (e.g. Busybox ash, dash, ZSH, Bash, ...)
* `sed` supporting GNU extensions: `\?`, `\+`, `\|`, `^` inside subexpressions, and `q` with exit code
* Python for rewriting internal links


== Features and Limitations

Most syntactic DokuWiki constructs can be converted to AsciiDoc.

Known limitations in the conversion from DokuWiki to AsciiDoc:

* No syntax checking is done of the input file.
* Appending a downloadable file (code snippet) to a Code block is not available (the link to the file is silently discarded by the converter).
* Anchors (links to a location on the same page) may not work due to different naming conventions.
* The vertical spanning (over several rows) of table cells is not provided.
* Text decorations and “text not to be parsed” marks are only converted if opening and closing marks are on the same line.
* Windows shares and Interwiki links are not converted.
* Embedding HTML and PHP is not available.
* RSS/Atom feed integration is not available.
* Text to image conversion is not available.


=== Supported Plugins

In addition to the basic DokuWiki syntax, the following plugins are supported:

[%header, cols="1,4,4"]
|===
| Plugin
| Limitations
| Notes

| {dw-plugin}:cli[cli]
| All attributes (prompt, comment, continue) are ignored.
| Converted to a source block with lang “sh”.

| {dw-plugin}:code[code]
| No limitations.
| Code title is converted to a block title.

| {dw-plugin}:code2[code2]
| Line number is ignored, no difference between header and footer.
| Header/footer is converted to a block title.

| {dw-plugin}:comment[comment]
| If comment is not properly terminated, the converter terminates with an error.
| Content between the marks is discarded from the output.

| {dw-plugin}:htmlcomment[htmlcomment]
| Recognized only when opening and closing tags are on the same line.
| Content between `++<!--++` and `++-->++` tags is discarded from the output.

| {dw-plugin}:latex[latex], {dw-plugin}:mathjax[mathjax]
| Latex delimiters are not recognized in a nowiki area.

`++$...$++` and `++$$...$$++` are not recognized when opening and closing delimiters are not on the same line.

`++$...$++` is converted only when there’s no alphanumeric character before/after opening/closing `$`, no space after/before opening/closing `$`, and no character with a special meaning after opening `$`.

a| * `++$...$++` is converted to `++stem:[...]++`,
   * `++$$...$$++` is converted to a STEM block,
   * `++<latex>...</latex>++` is converted to `++stem:[...]++` if opened/closed tags are on the same line, otherwise to a STEM block.

| {dw-plugin}:note[note]
| No limitations.
| Note is converted to a corresponding admonition block, or admonition paragraph if

| {dw-plugin}:yalist[yalist]
| Only (un)ordered list item with single extra paragraph denoted by `..` on the line immediately after the list item (`pass:[**]` or `--`) is supported.

== But Why Sed?

You may ask why I wrote this converter in _sed_, despite I consider it a bit insane.
Well, I’m not the original author.

Back in winter 2017, I needed some converter from DokuWiki to AsciiDoc.
The only ready-made solution I found was https://github.com/DidierSpaier/convtags[convtags] – a bidirectional (!) converter between DokuWiki and AsciiDoc.
It was originally developed for the Slackware Documentation Project that used to run on DokuWiki (see https://docs.slackware.com/howtos:misc:dokuwiki_versus_asciidoc_markups[this page]).
I tried it on few pages and it worked very well, even on complicated tables!

However, convtags was written for an older AsciiDoc syntax and didn’t support some features I needed.
It appeared to be quicker to improve convtags, even though it’s written completely in _sed_, than write a proper converter from scratch.
So I started digging into it.

At first it went well, but as I tried it on more pages, more and more bugs (in the original code) started to appear.
Not just minor bugs, but even quite fundamental.
Eventually I fixed or rewrote most of the convtags’ code.

Now it works very well for wide variety of DokuWiki pages, but it took me much more time than I expected.
I regret a little that I didn’t wrote a proper, modular converter from scratch instead.
However, it was _really_ very interesting experience (although a bit masochist).
I really like regular expressions, sed and challenges… and this was hell challenge!
I’ve learned a lot thanks to it.

The most essential sed magic in this converter is Didier’s work.
I’ve fixed many bugs and improved it a lot, yet I still don’t understand how exactly some of the tricks with hold space work.
Didier is a real sed master!
