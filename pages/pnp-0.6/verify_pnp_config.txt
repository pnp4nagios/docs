======verify_pnp_config======

In case of problems there is a script called ''verify_pnp_config.pl'' located on http://verify.pnp4nagios.org. It enables you to check the configuration settings as well as performance data of hosts or services. It can be used prior and during runtime of PNP.

*** ATTENTION ***: It ONLY supports verifying Nagios 3.x and Icinga 1.x as Monitoring core.

===== Download ======

<code>
wget http://verify.pnp4nagios.org/verify_pnp_config
</code>

===== Test ======

The verify script is located on http://verify.pnp4nagios.org and needs three start options


  * ''--mode'' One of the modes described on [[modes]]
  * ''--config'' Location of nagios.cfg or icinga.cfg
  * ''--pnpcfg'' Path to PNPÂ´s etc directory

Calling ''perl verify_pnp_config'' will show the available options.

The following is a sample run
<code>

===== Performance data =====
Starting with ''0.6.19-R.37'' (2013-02-17) the script will accept the option ''--object'' (or ''-o'')  followed by a string to specify a host name and/or service description to additionally show performance data (if any) of the object(s) found. The data is enclosed in brackets, followed by the value of the directive ''process_performance_data'' (''ppd''=n).

''host'' = show performance information for host ''host'' \\
'';service'' = show performance information for service ''service'' \\
''host;service'' = show performance information for service ''service'' on host ''host''

The strings are taken as regular expressions (perl syntax).
