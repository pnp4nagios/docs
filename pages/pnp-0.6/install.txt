====== Installation ======
The installation of PNP will be described in more detail. It is expected that nagios was compiled from source and is located in /usr/local/nagios.\\ 
**Attention:** The description applies to the developer version PNP 0.6.0.\\ 
Please note that PNP has to be configured after the installation.

===== Make and more =====
The installation of PNP is controlled by [[wpde>makefile]]s. The system is analyzed after invocation of ./configure and the detected values are tranferred to makefiles.

Please unpack PNP as user root:
<code>
tar -xvzf pnp4nagios-HEAD.tar.gz
cd pnp4nagios
</code>

./configure is to be called from the directory pnp4nagios.

<code>
./configure
</code>
**Note:** Without specifying any options user and group will be "nagios". If you have different values then please use the parameters "--with-nagios-user" and "--with-nagios-group", respectively. Using  Icinga the call might be
<code>
./configure --with-nagios-user=icinga --with-nagios-group=icinga
</code>
Some lines run across the screen. The output at the end is important.

*** Configuration summary for pnp4nagios-0.6.2 23-12-2009 ***

  General Options:
  -------------------------         -------------------
  Nagios user/group:                nagios nagios
  Install directory:                /usr/local/pnp4nagios
  HTML Dir:                         /usr/local/pnp4nagios/share
  Config Dir:                       /usr/local/pnp4nagios/etc
  Location of rrdtool binary:       /usr/bin/rrdtool Version 1.2.12
  RRDs Perl Modules:                FOUND (Version 1.2012)
  RRD Files stored in:              /usr/local/pnp4nagios/var/perfdata
  process_perfdata.pl Logfile:      /usr/local/pnp4nagios/var/perfdata.log

  Web Interface Options:  -------------------------         -------------------
  HTML URL:                         http://localhost/pnp4nagios/
  Apache Config File:               /etc/apache2/conf.d/pnp4nagios.conf


  Review the options above for accuracy.  If they look okay,
  type 'make all' to compile.</code>

The paths shown should be checked. If the displayed values aren't correct you can change them calling ./configure with appropriate options.\\ 
**Attention:** "Location of rrdtool binary" means path including name of binary! If necessary it can be specified using the following syntax:

   ./configure --with-rrdtool=/usr/local/rrdtool-1.2.xx/bin/rrdtool

   ./configure --help 

shows the supported options.\\ \\ 

Invoking
   make all

compiles the components like NPCD which are written in C

   make install

copies everything to the right places in the file system. The paths were already shows during ./configure.

After the installation of the program and HTML files you can copy a sample Apache configuration file to your web-server config directory

   make install-webconf

You can call

   make install-config

optionally. This way config files for process_perfdata.pl and npcd are copied to etc/pnp.

To install the NPCD Init script call

   make install-init

All these steps are combined in

   make fullinstall

**Note:** As already stated the Nagios settings will be used per default. If you are using Icinga the file '/etc/apache2/conf.d/pnp4nagios.conf' has to be edited to change the path to AuthUserFile (the path may differ between distributions): 
<code>#       AuthUserFile /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users
        AuthUserFile /usr/local/icinga/etc/htpasswd.users</code>

**Attention:** After copying the configuration file for the web server you have to restart the web server (''service httpd restart'' or ''/etc/init.d/apache2 restart'', respectively).

===== Update =====

The update of a 0.6.x version works (nearly) the same way as an installation. Please note that you have to call ''./configure'' with the same options you used during the first installation.
Please check if you changed anything in the folder ''share/templates.dist''. Own templates should be placed in ''share/templates'' to avoid being overwritten.\\ 
**Attention**: If you changed config.php then you should save this file before it is overwritten when you execute ''make install-config''.

You can skip ''make install-webconf'' and ''make install-init'' because nothing changed between 0.6.x versions.

===== The components =====

After installation the components of PNP were copied to the appropriate places in the file system. These are

the PHP-Files for the web-frontend below

   /usr/local/pnp4nagios/share

the data collector process_perfdata.pl in 

   /usr/local/pnp4nagios/libexec

sample config files with the suffix ''-sample'' in

   /usr/local/pnpnagios/etc

the config file config.php for the web frontend in 

   /usr/local/pnp4nagios/etc
