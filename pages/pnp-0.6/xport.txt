====== Data export ======

PNP provides access to RRD data using the ''xport'' controller. The output format can be specified. At the moment the formats ''xml'', ''json'' and ''csv'' are supported.

The controller can be called using the URL

  /pnp4nagios/xport/<format>?host=<hostname>&srv=<servicedesc>

whereas <format> has to be replaced with the desired format.


You can also use ''wget'' to generate images and place them in periodic reports. One example may be:
  wget -O image.png 'http://<user>:<pass>@<nagios-server>/pnp4nagios/image?host=<hostname>&srv=<service>&view=2&source=0'
''view=<n>'' limits the graph to the timeperiod specified in config.php \\
''source=<n>'' only shows one data source if you have more than one in your RRD file

Instead of ''view'' you can use ''start'' and/or ''end'' to specify the time period. For details please look at [[timeranges|"time ranges"]].
