====== Widgets ======

**Available starting with pnp4nagios-0.6.1**

Two widgets allow to integrate own data into the PNP web frontend.

  * share/application/views/widget_menu.php

This widget will be included in the menu.

  * share/application/views/widget_graph.php

This widget will be included above the first graph.

The widgets are available as sample files (.sample.php) after installation and can be used if needed.

As an example you can use these widgets to include links to other information into the PNP web interface without changing the source code of PNP.
