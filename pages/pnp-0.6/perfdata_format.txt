2.6. Performance data

Performance data is defined by Nagios as "everything after the | of the plugin output" - please refer to Nagios documentation for information on capturing this data to logfiles. However, it is the responsibility of the plugin writer to ensure the performance data is in a "Nagios plugins" format. This is the expected format:

'label'=value[UOM];[warn];[crit];[min];[max]

Notes:

   - space separated list of label/value pairs
   - //label// can contain any characters
   - the single quotes for the label are optional. Required if spaces, = or ' are in the label
   - label length is arbitrary, but ideally the first 19 characters are unique (due to a limitation in RRD). Be aware of a limitation in the amount of data that NRPE returns to Nagios
   -  to specify a quote character, use two single quotes
   -  //warn//, //crit//, //min/ or //max/ may be null (for example, if the threshold is not defined or min and max do not apply). Trailing unfilled semicolons can be dropped
   - min and max are not required if UOM=%
   - value, min and max in class [-0-9.]. Must all be the same UOM
   - warn and crit are in the range format (see Section 2.5). Must be the same UOM
   - UOM (unit of measurement) is one of:
      * no unit specified - assume a number (int or float) of things (eg, users, processes, load averages)
      * s - seconds (also us, ms)
      * % - percentage
      * B - bytes (also KB, MB, TB, GB?)
      * c - a continous counter (such as bytes transmitted on an interface)

It is up to third party programs to convert the Nagios plugins performance data into graphs.
