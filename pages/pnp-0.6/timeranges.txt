====== Timeranges ======

In the overview PNP shows five timeranges which can be defined in config.php.

Additionally you can influence the timeranges via the URL. This can be useful to automatically create PDF documents. The ranges can be defined using the options "start" and "end".

Example:

   pnp4nagios/graph?host=<hostname>&srv=<servicedesc>&start=-1week

The graph will start one week prior to the current date and time. It will end at the current timestamp.

^ start ^ end ^ view ^ result ^
|       |     |      |all views ending at current timestamp |
|  x    |     |      |all views starting at defined date |
|       |  x  |      |all views ending at defined date |
|  x    |  x  |      |one view between the two dates |
|       |     |  x   |one view ending at current timestamp |
|  x    |     |  x   |one view starting at defined date |
|       |  x  |  x   |one view ending at defined date |
