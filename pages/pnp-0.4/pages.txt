====== Pages ======


"pages" provide the opportunity to collect graphs of different hosts/services on one page. That way - as an example - you can display the traffic rates of all tape libraries. Regular expressions are possible so you can accomplish a lot with only few definitions - provided that you have appropriate names.
The directory specified using "$conf['page_dir']" contains one or more file with the extension ".cfg".

The file name (without the extension) appears in the list of available pages and will be used as title of the browser window. Comments start with a hash-sign (#) and are possible within lines as well. Each file contains a "page" definition which specifies the name of the page and it determines whether the following graph definition contains regular expressions or not.\\ 
**Attention:** "host_name" and "service_desc" refer to the name of the file in the perfdata directory, not to the definition in Nagios. Blanks are replaced by underscores (_).

<code>define  page  {
        use_regex 1		# 0 = use no regular expressions, 1 = use regular expressions
        page_name test-page	# page description
}</code>

One or more "graph" definitions follow:

<code>define graph {
        host_name       host1,host2,host3
        service_desc    Current_Load
}</code>

<code>define graph {
        host_name       host4
        service_desc    Current_Users
}</code>

And now some definitions with regular expressions. At first all hosts whose names are starting with "Tape": 
<code>define graph {
        host_name       ^Tape
        service_desc    Traffic
}</code>

all hosts whose names are ending with "00":
<code>define graph {
        host_name       00$
        service_desc    Load
}</code>

all services of localhost whose names contain "a" or "o", respectively:
<code>define graph {
        host_name       localhost
        service_desc    a|o
}</code>

all services whose names contain an underscore followed by (at least) three digits on all hosts whose names start with "UX":
<code>define graph {
        host_name       ^UX
        service_desc    _\d{3}
}</code>
