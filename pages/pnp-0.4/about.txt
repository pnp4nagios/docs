====== About PNP ======





===== System requirements =====

PNP mandatory requires valid performance data of nagios plugins.

So what is this performance data?

The output of a nagios plugin up to nagios 2.x is limited to one line. When the plugin produces performance data, it is divided into two parts. The pipe symbol ("|") is used as a delimiter.

**Example check_icmp :** 

   OK - 127.0.0.1: rta 2.687ms, lost 0% | rta=2.687ms;3000.000;5000.000;0; pl=0%;80;100;;

resulting in the text on the left side of the pipe symbol

   OK - 127.0.0.1: rta 2.687ms, lost 0%

and the performance data

    rta=2.687ms;3000.000;5000.000;0; pl=0%;80;100;;

Performance data is designed for automatic processing. The format is specified within the [[http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html#AEN203|Developer Guidelines]] but should be exemplified here nonetheless:

    rta=2.687ms;3000.000;5000.000;0;
     |    |  |    |         |     | |
     |----|--|----|---------|-----|-|----- * label 
          |--|----|---------|-----|-|----- * current value
             |----|---------|-----|-|----- unit ( UOM = UNIT of Measurement ) 
                  |---------|-----|-|----- warning threshold
                            |-----|-|----- critical threshold 
                                  |-|----- minimum value 
                                    |----- maximum value
                                    
Value marked with * are mandatory. All other values are optional.

Several data series are separated by blanks. The actual data must not contains any blanks. If the label contains blanks, it has to be surrounded by single quotes.





===== Required Software =====

  * Perl >= 5.x without additional modules
  * RRDtool >= 1.x, better 1.2 but not compulsory\\ Attention: installing RRDtool without a packet manager might lead to missing dejavu fonts. If you see graphs without text then this may be the cause.
  * PHP >= 4.3.10 for Webfrontend
    * PHP-extension zlib and GD.
  * Nagios 2.x oder higher

===== Support =====

PRIOR to support questions please make sure that you have verified certain things described under [[verify|verify your installation]].\\ \\ 
German support is available on http://nagios-portal.de. The developers will be informed about new postings in the PNP-section. Postings in english will be answered as well. Please use the "search" function first.\\ 
After registering as a user please fill out the profile regarding operating system and PNP version used. Please mention if you used a package or compiled the sources.
Please mark successfully solved threads by adding "[solved]" to the title as it helps other users to find a solution for their problem.

The mailing lists on Sourceforge can be used to request support (and are limited to english):

[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pnp4nagios-users|pnp4nagios-users]]: users list for general questions regarding configuration. Please state your operating system and PNP version

[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pnp4nagios-devel|pnp4nagios-devel]]: devel list for suggestions and error reports. Please state your operating system and PNP version

[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pnp4nagios-checkins|pnp4nagios-checkins]]: the checkin list automatically contains changes to the SVN repository


=====Storage=====

Performance data will be stored in Round Robin Databases using [[http://www.rrdtool.org|RRDtool]]. That means that after some time the oldest data will be dropped at the "end" and it will be replaced by new values "at the beginning".

Various intervals provide for different resolutions. Using the defaults allows to store the data with a resolution of one minute for the last two days, five minutes resolution for ten days, 30 minutes resolution for 90 days and 6 hours resolution for four years. The increasing interval causes averaging of the data which leads to smaller max values. This not an error of PNP.

Using this storage format the size of the files will stay the same over time. Per datasource you will need approx. 400 KB.
