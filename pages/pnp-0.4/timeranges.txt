====== Timeranges ======

In the overview PNP shows five timeranges which can be defined in config.php.

Additionally you can influence the end of the timeranges via the URL. This can be useful to automatically create PDF documents. The ranges can be defined using the option "end".

Example:

   http://<Nagios host>/pnp/index.php?host=<hostname>&srv=<servicedesc>&end=-1week

The graph will end one week prior to the current date and time. The start will be adjusted depending on the selected view.

^ end ^ view ^ result ^
|     |      |all views ending at current timestamp |
|  x  |      |all views ending at defined date |
|     |  x   |one view ending at current timestamp |
|  x  |  x   |one view ending at defined date |

Examples of different specifications

^  format   ^ description ^ 
| 2009W04   | 4. week of 2009 |
| 1.5.2009  | May, 1st 2009 |
| -1 day    | one day back |
| -3 weeks  | 3 weeks back |
| -1 year   | one year back  |
| yesterday | yesterday |

Using relative offsets (-<n> <timeperiod>) results in timestamps relative to the current time otherwise the ending time is at midnight.
