===== perfdata-dir-for-host =====

PNP was called with a host in the URL.

Example:
   http://<nagios-server>/pnp4nagios/graph?host=<this-host>

The resulting path to the perfdata directory could not be found.

The path is shown in the error message.

''var/perfdata/<this-host>'' will be created by process_perfdata.pl when it processes performance data for this host.

If this directory does not exist there are several possible causes:

  * Passing an incorrect host name in the URL
  * The host has no valid performance data
  * None of the services has valid performance data
