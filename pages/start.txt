====== PNP4Nagios Documentation ======

In the future the domain doc.pnp4nagios.org will be the central documentation platform for PNP.

The documentation of PNP 0.4.x is already transferred from www.pnp4nagios.org.\\
The documentation of PNP 0.6.x will be extended parallel to the development of this version.

====== Social Coding ======

[[http://github.com/lingej/pnp4nagios|{{:github.png |}}]] The 0.6.x Code is controlled by GIT SCM located on [[:pnp-0.6:dwnld|Sourceforge]]. You can also find a synced version of this repository on Github. Feel free to fork your own Repo!

====== The documentation is open ======

The following pages are editable by registered users.
Create an account and contribute to the project.

====== Contribution welcome ======

PNP wouldn't be where it it today without the numerous people who contributed over the last years, sometimes only in the background.

Contribution is explicitly welcome, even when not every function can be implemented at once. Starting with version 0.6.x this will change due to the changed architecture.

Furthermore this domain now supports multiple languages so I would be happy if other people add their native language.
